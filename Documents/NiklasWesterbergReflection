what do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I want to better understand the concept of working with scrum. 
    On a practial level understand the different steps and roles 
    as well as the retrospective and review face.I wish to better 
    understand how to work with agile development. I also lack 
    experience in working in a development team of this size and 
    have never before used GitHub or other such platforms for 
    software development and therefor wish to learn more about 
    how to use the features of the platform. 
  
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 * At this stage all members have pretty much the same level of 
   understanding of what we are doing and have mainly been able to 
   help each other by general discussion on scrum, Github and so on. 
   Further along the project we might get to shed some light on the 
   different levels of programming and project management skills that 
   different members of the group possess. When the time comes 
   it will be important to have an open attitude and extend a helping
   hand wherever you can. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
  * We have not yet been through an actual sprit but I have attended 
    class and have done some reading on the concept of scrum. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you 
will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts
and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), 
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how 
to make the change happen. The first week of the course 
you describe the current situation by motivating a 
learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change 
objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the 
change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week 
(e.g. describing the current situation).
  * Since we have not yet started the project it is difficult 
    to describe an objective for the week. But at this stage 
    I would identify the following objective: 
    To understand scrum well enough to be able to implement the 
    concept when starting the actual project.
